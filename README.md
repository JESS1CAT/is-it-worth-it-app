Is It Worth It? is a minimalist calculator designed to reframe spending in terms of your time — not just your money.

💸 Is It Worth It? – A Time-Value Calculator for Conscious Spending
Ever wonder how many hours of your life that new purchase is really going to cost you?

You input the cost of an item and your hourly wage, and it tells you how many hours of work you'd need to afford it… with a dose of humor, sass, or reflection based on the result.

Whether you're buying a coffee or a spaceship (please don't), this app helps you pause and check in with your values before you hit "add to cart."
