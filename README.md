**Is It Worth It?** is a minimalist calculator designed to reframe spending in terms of your time — not just your money.

💸 **Is It Worth It? – A Time-Value Calculator for Conscious Spending**  
Ever wonder how many hours of your life that new purchase is *really* going to cost you?

You input the cost of an item and your hourly wage, and it tells you how many hours of work you'd need to afford it… with a dose of humor, sass, or reflection based on the result.

Whether you're buying a coffee or a spaceship (please don't), this app helps you pause and check in with your values before you hit "add to cart."
